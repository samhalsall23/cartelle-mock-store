## 🧩 Key Implementations

For a deeper architecture walkthrough (including a demo video), see the case study:
https://samhalsall.dev/cartelle-case-study

### Cart + Checkout + Payment

Checkout is handled through server actions and Stripe integration:

1. Customer adds items by product + size into a cookie-scoped cart
2. Server validates per-item and total cart quantity limits
3. Checkout initiation reserves stock (`stockReserved`) atomically in Prisma
4. A Stripe Payment Intent is created and stored on the order (`stripeSessionId`)
5. Frontend checkout runs a three-step flow (delivery, payment, summary)
6. Stripe webhook finalizes order/payment status and decrements reserved stock

Core files:

```
src/lib/server/actions/cart-actions.ts
src/lib/server/actions/order-actions.ts
src/components/common/CheckoutForm/CheckoutForm.tsx
src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
```

Environment variables required:

```
DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

---

### Admin + Media Storage

The admin area supports product/blog/author content workflows and media uploads.

- Product images are uploaded through `POST /api/products/upload`
- Files are stored in Vercel Blob with resource-based path prefixes
- Scheduled Vercel crons remove orphaned assets and clear expired checkout carts

Core files:

```
src/app/admin/products/page.tsx
src/app/admin/blogs/page.tsx
src/app/admin/authors/page.tsx
src/app/api/products/upload/route.ts
src/app/api/cleanup-unused-images/route.ts
src/app/api/payment/cleanup-expired-carts/route.ts
vercel.json
```

Additional environment variables:

```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=
```

---

## 💻 Development

Install and run locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Database setup (first run):

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Optional local tooling:

```
npm run storybook
npm run lint
```

Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file in the project root:

```
DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=
DEMO_MODE=
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is configured for **Vercel** deployment.

- Pushes to `master` can be connected to automatic deployments
- Configure all runtime environment variables in Vercel Project Settings
- `vercel.json` includes scheduled maintenance jobs:
  - `0 2 * * *` → `/api/cleanup-unused-images`
  - `0 1 * * *` → `/api/payment/cleanup-expired-carts`

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add authentication for admin dashboard rather then using demo flag
- Add automated tests for server actions, webhook flows, and checkout steps
- Add observability around Stripe webhook and background cleanup jobs
- Improve product recommendation logic on product detail pages
